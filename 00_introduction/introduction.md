# AI Prompting for Product Managers: From Zero to Practical Application

## Welcome to Your AI Transformation Journey

As a Product Manager, you're already a master of many trades – user research, stakeholder communication, prioritization, roadmapping – the list goes on. But today's product landscape is evolving rapidly with AI tools that can dramatically amplify your capabilities.

This course is designed specifically for experienced Product Managers who want to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot – without needing to become an AI expert.

## Why This Course Matters

The truth? Many PMs are either:

- Using AI in basic, inefficient ways (like asking simple questions)
- Not using it at all due to uncertainty about capabilities
- Using it without structure, getting inconsistent results

By the end of these 5 days, you'll approach AI tools as a thoughtful product manager would: with clear use cases, structured methodologies, and measurable outcomes.

## What You'll Take Away

By the end of this course, you'll have:

- **A working mental model of LLMs**: Understand their strengths, limitations, and when to use them
- **6-10 reusable prompt templates**: Custom-built for PM/PO tasks like requirement drafting, stakeholder communications, and user story refinement
- **A checklist for refining prompts**: Systematically improve your prompts for better, more consistent results
- **A starter playbook**: Integrate AI smoothly into your existing PM workflow

## How This Course Works

Each day focuses on building practical skills you can immediately apply:

- **Day 1**: Learn the foundations of LLMs and basic prompt engineering
- **Day 2**: Master core prompting techniques for clearer results
- **Day 3**: Explore advanced prompting for complex PM tasks
- **Day 4**: Evaluate and iterate on LLM output for quality assurance
- **Day 5**: Implement real-life use cases and develop your prompt strategy

We've also included a bonus module on using AI ethically and effectively within team and enterprise contexts.

Each day includes theory, examples, hands-on practice exercises, and actionable tips you can use immediately.
